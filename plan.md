# Weft

An open, agent-friendly UI description format — strict markup for models, canonical JSON for tools — with a TypeScript prototype: parser, validator, catalog, renderer, importer and MCP server.

### T8. Evaluation

Paused until T20–T25 land: the final runs use the Rust core and the stricter benchmark.

Full benchmark run on two or three models against the baselines, and a report with a continue/stop recommendation. Done when first-try validity is at least 95%, validity after one repair cycle is at least 99%, and raw results are in the repository.

Execution plan:

1. Repair cycle in `bench/src/run-tasks.ts`: when an edit reply is invalid (unparseable or format errors), send one follow-up prompt with the previous reply and the validator's diagnostics, and record first-try and after-repair validity and success separately. Same rule for every format, so the baselines get the same help. Cover it with a mocked-provider test in `bench/test/checkers.test.ts`.
2. Summaries and the rendered table show first-try valid, valid after repair, first-try success, success after repair, and mean output tokens.
3. Models: Claude Sonnet 5.5, Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Haiku 4.5 (`DEFAULT_MODELS`).
4. Raw results go into the repository: stop ignoring `bench/results/`.
5. Trial run (one screen, all formats, one model) to check cost and the harness; the creator reviews it before the full run.
6. Full edit and read runs on the three models; `run.ts tokens` again so the report has Anthropic token counts.
7. `bench/EVALUATION.md`: results against the done criteria (Weft first-try validity at least 95%, after one repair at least 99%), comparison with the baselines, failure analysis, continue/stop recommendation.
8. Verify with `pnpm run ci`.

### T22. WebAssembly bindings

Build the Rust core and catalog with wasm-bindgen (wasm-pack) into the `@weft/core` and `@weft/catalog` packages, keeping their TypeScript API, so the browser, Deno, Bun and Node run the same code. The renderer, importer, JSX generator, MCP server and benchmark stay TypeScript and call these packages. This introduces a build step: `AGENTS.md` drops the "No build step" rule for these two packages. Done when every existing TypeScript test passes on the WASM build.

### T23. Native Node and Bun addon

A napi-rs addon of the same Rust core for Node and Bun, chosen at load time with the WASM build as the fallback when no prebuilt binary fits the platform. Done when the test suite passes on both builds and a broken or missing addon falls back to WASM with a warning.

### T24. Runtime matrix

Run the binding tests in Node, Deno, Bun and a headless browser through moon. Done when all four pass from one command.

### T26. Vitest for the TypeScript tests

Run every TypeScript test suite with Vitest (on Vite) instead of `node:test`: the 28 test files in `packages/*/test` and `bench/test` move to Vitest's API, `fast-check` stays for property tests, and each package's moon `test` task calls `vitest run`. Vitest's browser mode then serves the browser leg of T24, and the same suites check the WASM build of T22. `AGENTS.md` changes its test rule from `node:test` to Vitest. Done when every existing test passes under Vitest with the same count, `moon ci` is green, and `node:test` is no longer used.

### T28. Binding readback against inverted conditions

In the Bonsai edit smoke run (`login.e2`) the model was asked to disable Sign in while `$.busy` is true. It changed `{!$.email}` to `{!$.busy}` and kept the `!`. The markup is valid, but the condition is inverted. The HTML and JSX baselines got it right. Validation cannot see intent. The model can, if the core tells it in plain words what a binding means. Depends on T20.

1. `weft-core`: `explain(document)` reads every binding as a sentence, e.g. `button#submit disabled: while $.busy is false`. `explain_changes(before, after)` lists only the props, events and bindings that changed.
2. CLI: `weft explain <file> [--against <old-file>]`.
3. `AGENT-SPEC.md` repair loop: before answering, read back the changed bindings and compare them with the instruction.
4. Benchmark: an optional readback turn after a valid edit, the same for every format. This is a method change, recorded in `test.md`. Rerun `login` on Bonsai with 3 samples.

Done when the tests for `explain` pass, the CLI prints readbacks, and the rerun is in the `test.md` history.

Execution plan (steps 1–3; step 4 waits for the creator's go-ahead on the method change and a local LM Studio model):

- Core, new module `crates/weft-core/src/explain.rs` with exports in `lib.rs` only, so no other core module changes. `explain(document, catalog)` returns one `Readback { path, target, name, sentence }` per bound or token prop, event and `<each>`; `explain_changes(before, after, catalog)` returns `Change { target, name, kind, before, after }` for every prop (literals included), event and loop that was added, removed or changed, matching elements by id. Elements are named `kind#id`, or by their SPEC §6.1 diagnostic path when they have no valid id (reusing `path_segment`), so slots appear as `slot[name]`. Sentences never hide a negation: a negated binding reads `true while $.busy is falsy (NOT $.busy)`, a plain binding on a boolean prop `true while $.busy is truthy`, other bindings `reads $.x` with `; user input writes $.x` on writable props, tokens `design token space.md`, events `runs action auth.submit`, loops `repeats its children once per item of $.todos, as $todo`. Pure, no I/O; unit tests named as claims in the module.
- CLI: `weft explain <file> [--against <old-file>] [--catalog <file>]` in `crates/weft-cli`, one line per readback or change on stdout; diagnostics with errors in either file print as in `validate` and exit 1; usage and I/O failures exit 2. End-to-end cases in `crates/weft-cli/tests/cli.rs`, including the `login.e2` inversion.
- `AGENT-SPEC.md` §4: read back the changed bindings before answering (`weft explain --against` when a tool is available, otherwise read `!` as NOT) and compare each with the instruction; one checklist line. `bench/test/agent-spec.test.ts` must stay green.
- Verify: `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo nextest run --workspace`, the binary on a corpus screen, `moon run :test root:typecheck root:lint root:rust-test root:rust-lint`.

Progress: steps 1–3 are done. `explain` and `explain_changes` live in `crates/weft-core/src/explain.rs` with unit tests, `weft explain` in `crates/weft-cli` with end-to-end tests, and `AGENT-SPEC.md` §4.1 holds the readback loop. Remaining: step 4 (the optional readback turn in the benchmark, recorded in `test.md`, and the `login` rerun on Bonsai with 3 samples), which waits for the creator's go-ahead on the method change and a local LM Studio model.

### T29. Rust core test suite

The Rust core (T20) and catalog (T21) are checked mostly by the differential fixtures, which prove agreement with TypeScript but not the claims themselves, and they cover only inputs the generators reach. This task gives `weft-core` and `weft-catalog` their own tests: unit tests named as claims for every public function, and property tests that no input panics, that parse → serialize → parse is stable, and that formatting is idempotent. Done when every public function has tests for its documented behaviour, the property tests run in `cargo nextest`, and `moon ci` is green.
